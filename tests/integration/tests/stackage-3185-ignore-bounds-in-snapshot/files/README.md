The test case here is weird enough to warrant an explanation. What we
_really_ want to test is whether building the lts-3.12 snapshot's
semigroupoids package with rev-1 works. See
https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/issues/3185. However, that test
requires that we use an older GHC, and as Manny commented:

So I'm instead testing a totally different case here which repros the
same issue. If we use a custom snapshot with incompatible `stm` and
`async` versions, we want Stack to trust the build plan and allow a
`--dry-run` to succeed. But if we do this via `extra-deps`, we want it
to fail.
