# Releases

!!! todo "To do - Simplify the branch or version structure"

    Just release from the `master` branch (but keep the `stable` branch
    tracking the latest stable release plus updates to documentation).

## Version scheme

A Stack package or executable may have a version with three or four components:
X.Y.Z or X.Y.Z.A.

### Development or stable versions

* Versions with an _even_ 'Y' component are development versions (the `master`
  branch)
* Versions with an _odd_ 'Y' component are stable versions (the `stable` branch,
  or in a `rc/vX.Y` release candidate branch for not-yet-released versions)

### Unreleased or released versions

* Versions with an _even_ 'Z' component are unreleased versions (including
  release candidates)
* Versions with an _odd_ 'Z' component are released versions
* Except for the `release` branch (which matches exactly the most recent
  release), all branches must have an even 'Z' component
* Branches other than `stable`, `release`, and a `rc/vX.Y` release candidate
  will always have a `0` 'Z' component

### Use of a fourth component

* Release candidate binaries will be released with an odd 'A' component
* Hackage-only dependency compatibility patch releases add a 'A' component
  (e.g. v1.7.3.1, in the `release` branch)
* Pre-release unstable binaries will be released with the date as the 'A'
  component (e.g. 2.10.0.20220920)

Examples:

* `1.7.0.0`: v1.7.x series pre-release branch (`v1.7` branch)
* `1.7.0.1`: release candidate for first release of v1.7.x series (`v1.7`
  branch)
* `1.7.0.2`: continuing development on pre-release branch
* `1.7.0.3`: second release candidate for first release of v1.7.x series (`v1.7`
  branch)
* `1.7.1`: first release of the 1.7.x series (`release` branch)
* `1.7.2.0`: development for second release of 1.7.x series (`stable` branch)
* `1.7.2.1`: release candidate for second release of 1.7.x series (`stable`
  branch)
* `1.7.3`: second release of 1.7.x series (`release` branch)
* `1.7.3.1`: first Hackage-only patch of 1.7.3 (`release` branch)
* `1.7.3.2`: second Hackage-only patch of 1.7.3 (`release` branch)
* `1.8.0`: unstable development code (`master` branch)
* `1.8.0.20181004`: pre-release snapshot of unstable version (`master` branch)

## Pre-release checks

1.  Check for any P0 and P1 issues that should be dealt with before release.

2.  Check for un-merged pull requests that should be merged before release.

3.  Ensure the `release` and `stable` branches are merged to the `master`
    branch.

4.  Check the copyright dates, and update if needed.

5.  Ensure CI matrices in docs (travis-complex, appveyor, azure) have current
    stackage snapshots and GHC versions (e.g.
    https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/4565/files)

6.  Update the `stack-*.yaml` that uses a `nightly` snapshot to the latest
    nightly (go over the extra-deps too) and ensure the project builds and tests
    pass. For example, command:

    ~~~text
    stack build --stack-yaml=… --haddock --test --bench --no-run-benchmarks
    ~~~

7.  The Windows installer is built using an
    [NSIS compiler](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page). Check that the NSIS
    compiler that will be used is capable of handling
    [large strings](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Special_Builds).

8.  Ensure the integration tests pass on Linux, macOS and Windows.

9.  Some people prefer, or need, to build Stack with Cabal (the tool). Check
    that `cabal.project` is up to date (the specified `with-compiler:`). Check
    that `cabal.config` is up to date and is not missing dependencies relevant
    on Windows and non-Windows operating systems, following the instructions in
    `cabal.project`.

## Release preparation

### A: In the `master` branch

* `package.yaml`: bump to the next release candidate version (bump the second
  component to the next odd number, ensure the third component is `0`, and add
  patchlevel `0`; e.g. from `1.8.0` to `1.9.0.0`).

    !!! attention

        Be sure to update also `stack.cabal` (for example by using
        `stack build --dry-run`).

* `ChangeLog.md`: Check for any entries that snuck into the previous version's
  changes due to merges (`git diff origin/stable HEAD ChangeLog.md`)

### B: Create a new release candidate branch

Cut a new release candidate (RC) branch named `rc/vX.Y` from the `master`
branch.

### C: Return to the `master` branch

1.  `package.yaml`: bump version to the next unstable version (bump the second
    component to the next even number, ensure the third component is `0`; e.g.
    from `1.9.0` to `1.10.0`).

    !!! attention

        Be sure to update also `stack.cabal` (for example by using
        `stack build --dry-run`).

2.  `Changelog.md`:
    *   Change the title of the existing **Unreleased changes** section to what
        will be the next final (non-RC) release (e.g. `v2.1.1`).
    *   Add new "Unreleased changes" section:

        ~~~markdown
        ## Unreleased changes

        Release notes:

        **Changes since vX.Y.Z:**

        Major changes:

        Behavior changes:

        Other enhancements:

        Bug fixes:
        ~~~

3.  `cabal.config`: Ensure the `stack` constraint is set to the same version as
    in the `package.yaml`.

### D: In the release candidate branch

Review documentation for any changes that need to be made:

* Ensure all the documentation pages are listed in the `mkdocs.yaml` file. Use
  `git diff --stat origin/stable..HEAD doc/` to look for new or deleted files.
* Any new documentation pages should have the "may not be correct for
  the released version of Stack" warning at the top.
* Search for old Stack version, unstable Stack version, and the next "obvious"
  possible versions in sequence, and `UNRELEASED` and replace with next release
  version (`X.Y.1`, where Y is odd).

    !!! attention

        Do **NOT** update the Dockerfiles in
        [stackage/automated/dockerfiles](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/tree/master/automated/dockerfiles/)
        yet. That step will come later.

    !!! attention

        Do **NOT** update the repository's issue and pull request templates (in
        the `.github` directory)to point at the new release version yet!

* Search for old resolvers, set to latest resolver (e.g. in `doc/GUIDE.md` where
  it references the "currently the latest LTS")
* Look for any links to "latest" (`latest/`) documentation, replace with
  version tag

Check for any platform entries that need to be added to (or removed from):

* [releases.yaml](https://github.com/fpco/stackage-content/blob/master/stack/releases.yaml),
* [install_and_upgrade.md](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/master/doc/install_and_upgrade.md),
* [get-stack.sh](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/master/etc/scripts/get-stack.sh),
* [doc/README.md](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/blob/master/doc/README.md),
  and
* `get.haskellstack.org` redirects.

### E: For the first release candidate

1.  Re-do the pre-release checks (see the section above).
2.  `package.yaml`: bump to first odd patchlevel version (e.g. `X.Y.0.1`).

    !!! attention

        Be sure to update also `stack.cabal` (for example by using
        `stack build --dry-run`).

3.  `ChangeLog.md`: Rename the “Unreleased changes” section to the same version
    as `package.yaml`, and mark it clearly as a release candidate (e.g.
    `vX.Y.0.1 (release candidate)`). Remove any empty sections.
4.  Ensure the `stack` constraint in `cabal.config` is set to `==X.Y.0.1`.
5.  Follow the steps in the *Release process* section below that apply to a
    release candidate.

### F: For any subsequent release candidates

1.  Re-do the pre-release checks (see the section above).
2.  `package.yaml`: bump to next odd patchlevel version (e.g. `X.Y.0.3`).

    !!! attention

        Be sure to update also `stack.cabal` (for example by using
        `stack build --dry-run`).

3.  `ChangeLog.md`: Rename the "Unreleased changes" section to the new version,
    clearly marked as a release candidate (e.g. `vX.Y.0.3 (release candidate)`).
    Remove any empty sections.
4.  Ensure the `stack` constraint in `cabal.config` is set to the same version
    as in `package.yaml`.
5.  Follow the steps in the *Release process* section below that apply to a
    release candidate.

### G: For the final release

1.  Re-do the pre-release checks (see the section above).
2.  `package.yaml`: bump version to odd last component and no patchlevel
    (e.g. from `X.Y.0.2` to `X.Y.1`).

    !!! attention

        Be sure to update also `stack.cabal` (for example by using
        `stack build --dry-run`).

3.  `ChangeLog.md`: consolidate all the release candidate changes into a single
    section for the final release version.
4.  Ensure the `stack` constraint in `cabal.config` is set to the same version
    as in `package.yaml` (e.g. to `==X.Y.1`).
5.  Follow all of the steps in the *Release process* section below that apply to
    a final release.

## Release process

The release process differs between a first, second etc release candidate and a
final release.

=== "First, second etc RC"

    ### A: Integration tests workflow passes

    Ensure that the GitHub
    [Integration Tests workflow](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+tests%22)
    passes on the branch that you are releasing.

    This workflow will run automatically for the `rc/*` branch.

    ### B: Push a Git tag

    Push a Git tag. The tag should be `rc/vX.Y.Z.A`, with `X.Y.Z.A` matching the
    version in `package.yaml`.

    For example, command:

    ~~~text
    git tag -m rc/vX.Y.Z.A rc/vX.Y.Z.A
    git push origin rc/vX.Y.Z.A
    ~~~

    ### C: Edit the draft GitHub release, and publish it

    Wait for the GitHub
    [Integration Tests workflow](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+tests%22)
    to complete for the branch you just created. This will create a draft GitHub
    release and upload the bindists (plus signatures and hashes) to it.

    Edit the draft
    [GitHub release](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/):

    * Add `(release candidate)` to the name field and ensure that
      *This is a pre-release* is checked.
    * Add the ChangeLog to the description.

    Publish the GitHub release.

    ### D: Consider adding other platforms to the GitHub release

    The
    [Integration Tests workflow](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+tests%22)
    is limited to the platforms supported by the GitHub-hosted runners
    (currently, only x86_64) and any self-hosted runners (currently, only
    Linux/AArch64). However, it is possible to edit the GitHub release to
    include binary distributions for other platforms (for example,
    macOS/AArch64). The prerequisites are:

    * a computer with that platform (operating system, machine architecture);
    * a sufficiently-recent existing version of Stack for that platform (for
      example, GHCup has published versions of Stack for macOS/AArch64);
    * a tool to print SHA checksums, such as `shasum` on Linux and macOS; and
    * the GNU Privacy Guard tool (`gpg`), which has had imported the private key
      used to sign Stack executables (see further below).

    The steps are similar to those in the workflow:

    1.  Change to the root directory of the Stack project.

    2.  `stack etc/scripts/release.hs check`, to check before building.

    3.  `stack etc/scripts/release.hs build`, to build. The output 'assets'
        (`stack-<version>-<os>-<architecture> ...`) will be in
        the `_release` directory in the root directory of the Stack project.

    4.  For each of the output assets, create a corresponding SHA 256 file with
        a `.sha256` extension. For example (where `<asset>` is the name of the
        file):

        ~~~text
        shasum -a 256 <asset> > <asset>.sha256
        ~~~

    5.  For each of the output assets, create a corresponding ASCII-armored
        signature file with an `.asc` extension using `gpg`. For example (where
        `<asset>` is the name of the file):

        ~~~text
        gpg --digest-algo=sha512 --detach-sig --armor -u 0x575159689BEFB442 <asset>
        ~~~

    6.  Edit the GitHub release to include the output assets and their
        corresponding `.sha256` and `.asc` files.

    The private key used to sign Stack executables can be exported from a
    version of `gpg` to which it has previously been imported with:

    ~~~text
    gpg --armor --export-secret-key 0x575159689BEFB442
    ~~~

    The private key, so obtained, can be imported into `gpg` by:

    1.  Commanding `gpg --import`.

    2.  Pasting the private key.

    3.  Entering Ctrl+D and Enter.

    ### E: Update versions and `ChangeLog.md` for 'unreleased'

    In the `rc/vX.Y` branch:

    * `package.yaml`: bump the version number. Bump the fourth component to an
       even number (e.g. from 1.7.0.1 to 1.7.0.2).

        !!! attention

            Be sure to update also `stack.cabal` (for example by using
            `stack build --dry-run`).

    * `ChangeLog.md`: Add an “Unreleased changes” section (update the “changes
      since” version):

        ~~~markdown
        ## Unreleased changes

        Release notes:

        **Changes since vX.Y.Z:**

        Major changes:

        Behavior changes:

        Other enhancements:

        Bug fixes:
        ~~~

    ### F: Announce the release candidate

    Announce the release candidate to the following mailing lists

    * haskell-cafe@haskell.org

        !!! note

            You have to be a member of the mailing list to post to it. See the
            list's
            [interface](https://mail.haskell.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe)

    * haskell-stack@googlegroups.com

        !!! note

            Members of the group can post but posts from new members are held
            for moderation.

    * commercialhaskell@googlegroups.com

        !!! note

            Members of the group can post but posts from new members are held
            for moderation.

    Announce the release candidate on the
    [Haskell Community](https://discourse.haskell.org/c/announcements/10/l/latest).

    Announce the release candidate in the `#stack-users` channel of the Haskell
    Foundation's Slack workspace.

    Announce the release candidate in the
    [Haskell Stack room](https://matrix.to/#/#haskell-stack:matrix.org)
    (address `#haskell-stack:matrix.org`) on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/).

    Announce the release candidate in Reddit's
    [Haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) community.

    In each case, use the subject (change 'first' to 'second' etc for subsequent
    release candidates):

    * `ANN: first release candidate for stack-X.Y.Z`

    In the message, include:

    * a link to the release on GitHub
      (`https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/rc/vX.Y.Z.A`) to
      download it
    * the release description from Github.

=== "Final Release"

    ### A: Integration tests workflow passes

    Ensure that the GitHub
    [Integration Tests workflow](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+tests%22)
    passes on the branch that you are releasing.

    This workflow will run automatically for `rc/*` branches.

    ### B: Push a Git tag

    Push a Git tag. The tag should be `vX.Y.Z`, where `X.Y.Z` matches the
    version in `package.yaml`.

    For example, command:

    ~~~text
    git tag -m vX.Y.Z vX.Y.Z
    git push origin vX.Y.Z
    ~~~

    ### C: Edit the draft GitHub release, and publish it

    Wait for the GitHub
    [Integration Tests workflow](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+tests%22)
    to complete for the tag you just created. This will create a draft GitHub
    release and upload the bindists (plus signatures and hashes) to it.

    Edit the draft
    [GitHub release](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/):

    *   Add the ChangeLog to the description.
    *   Get the list of contributors to the release and add it to the
        description. For example, command:

        === "Unix-like"

            ~~~text
            git shortlog -s origin/release..HEAD|sed 's/^[0-9 \t]*/* /'|LC_ALL=C sort -f
            ~~~

        === "Windows (with PowerShell)"

            ~~~text
            (git shortlog -s origin/release..HEAD) -Replace '^[0-9 \t]*', '* ' | Sort-Object
            ~~~

    Publish the GitHub release.

    ### D: Consider adding other platforms to the GitHub release

    The
    [Integration Tests workflow](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+tests%22)
    is limited to the platforms supported by the GitHub-hosted runners
    (currently, only x86_64) and any self-hosted runners (currently, only
    Linux/AArch64). However, it is possible to edit the GitHub release to
    include binary distributions for other platforms (for example,
    macOS/AArch64). The prerequisites are:

    * a computer with that platform (operating system, machine architecture);
    * a sufficiently-recent existing version of Stack for that platform (for
      example, GHCup has published versions of Stack for macOS/AArch64);
    * a tool to print SHA checksums, such as `shasum` on Linux and macOS; and
    * the GNU Privacy Guard tool (`gpg`), which has had imported the private key
      used to sign Stack executables (see further below).

    The steps are similar to those in the workflow:

    1.  Change to the root directory of the Stack project.

    2.  `stack etc/scripts/release.hs check`, to check before building.

    3.  `stack etc/scripts/release.hs build`, to build. The output 'assets'
        (`stack-<version>-<os>-<architecture> ...`) will be in
        the `_release` directory in the root directory of the Stack project.

    4.  For each of the output assets, create a corresponding SHA 256 file with
        a `.sha256` extension. For example (where `<asset>` is the name of the
        file):

        ~~~text
        shasum -a 256 <asset> > <asset>.sha256
        ~~~

    5.  For each of the output assets, create a corresponding ASCII-armored
        signature file with an `.asc` extension using `gpg`. For example (where
        `<asset>` is the name of the file):

        ~~~text
        gpg --digest-algo=sha512 --detach-sig --armor -u 0x575159689BEFB442 <asset>
        ~~~

    6.  Edit the GitHub release to include the output assets and their
        corresponding `.sha256` and `.asc` files.

    The private key used to sign Stack executables can be exported from a
    version of `gpg` to which it has previously been imported with:

    ~~~text
    gpg --armor --export-secret-key 0x575159689BEFB442
    ~~~

    The private key, so obtained, can be imported into `gpg` by:

    1.  Commanding `gpg --import`.

    2.  Pasting the private key.

    3.  Entering Ctrl+D and Enter.

    ### E: Upload to Hackage and reset branches

    Upload the `stack` package to Hackage with the command:

    ~~~text
    stack upload . --pvp-bounds=lower
    ~~~

    Reset the `release` branch to the released commit. For example, with the
    commands:

    ~~~text
    git checkout release
    git merge --ff-only vX.Y.Z
    git push origin release
    ~~~

    Update the `stable` branch to the released commit. For example, with the
    commands:

    ~~~text
    git checkout stable
    git merge --ff-only vX.Y.Z
    git push origin stable
    ~~~

    Merge any changes made in the RC, `release` or `stable` branches to the
    `master` branch. Be careful about version and `ChangeLog.md`. It is best to
    do this by making a `ci/merge-stable-to-master` branch and waiting for CI to
    pass, then merging. If anything is complicated to merge, consider making it
    a pull request and getting it reviewed rather than merging immediately.

    Delete the RC branch, both locally and on the remote. For example with the
    commands:

    ~~~text
    git branch -d rc/vX.Y
    git push origin :rc/vX.Y
    ~~~

    ### F: Activate the version on Read The Docs

    Activate the version for new release tag, on
    [readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/projects/stack/versions/).

    Ensure that the `stable` documentation has updated.

    ### G: Update get.haskellstack.org redirects

    Update the https://get.haskellstack.org redirects by updating the
    `_redirects` file in the root of the
    `commercialhaskell/get-haskellstack-org` GitHub
    [repository](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/get-haskellstack-org).

    For further information, see the
    [get.haskellstack.org redirects](haskellstack.org.md#gethaskellstackorg-redirects)
    documentation.

    Test with the commands:

    === "Unix-like"

        ~~~text
        curl -vL https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/linux-x86_64.tar.gz >/dev/null
        curl -vL https://get.haskellstack.org/upgrade/linux-x86_64.tar.gz >/dev/null
        ~~~

    === "Windows (with PowerShell)"

        ~~~text
        curl -vL https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/linux-x86_64.tar.gz >NUL
        curl -vL https://get.haskellstack.org/upgrade/linux-x86_64.tar.gz >NUL
        ~~~

    and make sure it redirects to the new version.

    ### H: Update versions and `ChangeLog.md` for 'unreleased'

    In the `stable` branch:

    * `package.yaml`: bump the version number. Bump the third component to an
      even number (e.g. from `1.6.1` to `1.6.2`).

        !!! attention

            Be sure to update also `stack.cabal` (for example by using
            `stack build --dry-run`).

    * `ChangeLog.md`: Add an “Unreleased changes” section (update the “changes
      since” version):

        ~~~markdown
        ## Unreleased changes

        Release notes:

        **Changes since vX.Y.Z:**

        Major changes:

        Behavior changes:

        Other enhancements:

        Bug fixes:
        ~~~

    ### I: Update the repository's issue and pull request templates

    The repository's issue and pull request templates are the `.github`
    directory. Update them to refer to the new release version (`X.Y.Z`).

    ### J: Announce the release

    Announce the release to the following mailing lists

    * haskell-cafe@haskell.org

        !!! note

            You have to be a member of the mailing list to post to it. See the

    ### K: Update Docker images

    Docker Hub includes Docker images under
    [`fpco/stack-build'](https://hub.docker.com/r/fpco/stack-build).

    Update those images with a new version:

    1.  Under
        [commercialhaskell/stackage/automated/dockerfiles](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/tree/master/automated/dockerfiles/),
        add `lts-X.Y/Dockerfile` (where `X.Y` is the latest Stackage Haskell LTS
        version), containing (where `X.Z` is the previous Haskell LTS version,
        and `X.Y.Z` is the newly released Stack version):

        ~~~dockerfile
        FROM $DOCKER_REPO:lts-X.Z
        ARG STACK_VERSION=X.Y.Z
        RUN wget -qO- https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/download/v$STACK_VERSION/stack-$STACK_VERSION-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz --wildcards --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local/bin '*/stack'
        ~~~

    2.  Run `./build.sh lts-X.Y`. Then test that the new image has the new
        version of Stack. For example, command:

        ~~~text
        docker run --rm fpco/stack-build:lts stack --version
        ~~~

    3.  Use the following commands to push the new image to the registry:

        ~~~text
        ./build.sh --push lts-X.Y
        ./build.sh --push --small lts-X.Y
        ~~~
