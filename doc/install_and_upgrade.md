# Install/upgrade

For common Un*x operating systems (including macOS), all you need to do is run:

    curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

or:

    wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

Distribution packages are available for [Ubuntu](#ubuntu), [Debian](#debian),
[Fedora](#fedora),
[Arch Linux](#arch-linux) and [FreeBSD](#freebsd).
Binaries for other operating systems are listed below, and available on
[the Github releases page](https://github.com/fpco/stack/releases). For the
future, we are open to supporting more OSes (to request one, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/new)).

Binary packages are signed with this [signing key](SIGNING_KEY.md).

If you are writing a script that needs to download the latest binary, you can
find links that always point to the latest bindists
[here](https://www.stackage.org/stack).

## Windows

We recommend installing to the default location with these installers, as that
will make `stack install` and `stack upgrade` work correctly out of the box.

  * [Windows 64-bit Installer](https://www.stackage.org/stack/windows-x86_64-installer)
  * [Windows 32-bit Installer](https://www.stackage.org/stack/windows-i386-installer)

If in doubt: you should prefer the 64-bit installer.

You may see a "Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from
starting" warning when you try to run the installer. If so, click on
**More info**, and then click on the **Run anyway** button that appears.

### Manual download

* Download the latest release:

    * [Windows 64-bit](https://www.stackage.org/stack/windows-x86_64)
    * [Windows 32-bit](https://www.stackage.org/stack/windows-i386)

* Unpack the archive and place `stack.exe` somewhere on your `%PATH%` (see
  [Path section below](#path)) and you can then run `stack` on the command line.

* Now you can run `stack` from the terminal.

## macOS

We generally test on the current version of macOS, but Stack is known to work
on Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite and Mavericks as well, and may also work on older
versions (YMMV).

### Installer script

Run:

    curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

### Manual download

* Download the latest release:
    * [macOS 64-bit](https://www.stackage.org/stack/osx-x86_64)
* Extract the archive and place `stack` somewhere on your `$PATH` (see
  [Path section below](#path))
* Now you can run `stack` from the terminal.

### Using Homebrew

If you have the popular [brew](https://brew.sh/) tool installed, you can just do:

    brew install haskell-stack

* The Homebrew formula and bottles are **unofficial** and lag slightly behind new Stack releases,
but tend to be updated within a day or two.
* Normally, Homebrew will install from a pre-built binary (aka "pour from a
bottle"), but if `brew` starts trying to build everything from source (which
will take hours), see
[their FAQ on the topic](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#why-do-you-compile-everything).

### Notes

After installation, running `stack setup` might fail with `configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.` in which case you should run:

    xcode-select --install

If you are on OS X 10.11 ("El Capitan") and encounter either of these
problems, see the linked FAQ entries:

  * [GHC 7.8.4 fails with `/usr/bin/ar: permission denied`](faq.md#usr-bin-ar-permission-denied)
  * [DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is ignored](faq.md#dyld-library-path-ignored)
  

If you are on OS X 10.12 ("Sierra") and encounter [GHC panic while building, see this issue](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/2577)

## Ubuntu

Use the [generic Linux option](#linux).

There is also
a
[Ubuntu package](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=haskell-stack&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all) for
Ubuntu 16.04 and up. Note that the distribution's Stack version lags behind, so
we recommend running `stack upgrade` after installing it.

## Debian

Use the [generic Linux option](#linux).

There is also
a
[Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=haskell-stack&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all) for
Stretch and up. Note that the distribution's Stack version lags behind, so
we recommend running `stack upgrade` after installing it.

## <a name="centos"></a>CentOS / Red Hat / Amazon Linux

Use the [generic Linux option](#linux).

There is also an unofficial
[Copr repo](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/petersen/stack/).
Note that this Stack version may lag behind,
so we recommend running `stack upgrade` after installing it.

## Fedora

Use the [generic Linux option](#linux).

There is also an
unofficial
[Fedora Copr repo](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/petersen/stack/) which
can be enabled with: `sudo dnf copr enable petersen/stack`. Note that this Stack
version may lag behind, so we recommend running `stack upgrade` after installing
it.

## <a name="suse"></a>openSUSE / SUSE Linux Enterprise

Use the [generic Linux option](#linux).

There is also an unofficial SUSE package.  Note that this Stack
version may lag behind, so we recommend running `stack upgrade` after installing
it.  To install it:

 1. Add the appropriate OBS repository:

      * openSUSE Tumbleweed

        all needed is in distribution

      * openSUSE Leap

            sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/haskell/openSUSE_Leap_42.1/devel:languages:haskell.repo

      * SUSE Linux Enterprise 12

            sudo zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/haskell/SLE_12/devel:languages:haskell.repo

 2. Install:

        sudo zypper in stack

## Arch Linux

There is an official package in the Arch community repository. So you can
install it by simply doing:

    sudo pacman -S stack

Note that this version may slightly lag behind, but it should be updated within
the day. The package is also always rebuilt and updated when one of it's
dependencies gets an update.

  - [stack](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/stack/) _latest stable version_
  - [haskell-stack-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/haskell-stack-git/) _git version_

In order to use `stack setup` with older versions of GHC or on a 32-bit system,
you may need the
[ncurses5-compat-libs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ncurses5-compat-libs/)
AUR package installed. If this package is not installed, Stack may not be able
to install older (< 7.10.3) or 32-bit GHC versions.

If you use the
[ArchHaskell repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ArchHaskell), you
can also get the `haskell-stack-tool` package from there.

## NixOS

Users who follow the `nixos-unstable` channel or the Nixpkgs `master` branch can install the latest `stack` release into their profile by running:

    nix-env -f "<nixpkgs>" -iA haskellPackages.stack

Alternatively, the package can be built from source as follows.

 1. Clone the git repo:

        git clone https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack.git

 2. Create a `shell.nix` file:

        cabal2nix --shell ./. --no-check --no-haddock > shell.nix

    Note that the tests fail on NixOS, so disable them with `--no-check`. Also, haddock currently doesn't work for stack, so `--no-haddock` disables it.

 3. Install stack to your user profile:

        nix-env -i -f shell.nix

For more information on using Stack together with Nix, please see [the NixOS
manual section on
Stack](http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#how-to-build-a-haskell-project-using-stack).

## <a name="linux"></a>Linux (generic)

### Installer script

Run:

    curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

or:

    wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

### Manual download

* Download the latest release:

    * [Linux 64-bit, static](https://www.stackage.org/stack/linux-x86_64-static)

    * [Linux 32-bit, standard](https://www.stackage.org/stack/linux-i386)

    * [Linux 32-bit, libgmp4](https://www.stackage.org/stack/linux-i386-gmp4)
      (if you are on an older 32-bit distribution that only includes libgmp4
      (libgmp.so.3), such as CentOS/RHEL/Amazon Linux 6.)

* Extract the archive and place `stack` somewhere on your `$PATH` (see [Path section below](#path))

* Ensure you have required system dependencies installed.  These include GCC, GNU make, xz, perl, libgmp, libffi, and zlib.  We also recommend Git and GPG.  To install these using your package manager:
    * Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install g++ gcc libc6-dev libffi-dev libgmp-dev make xz-utils zlib1g-dev git gnupg`
    * Fedora / CentOS: `sudo dnf install perl make automake gcc gmp-devel libffi zlib xz tar git gnupg` (use `yum` instead of `dnf` on CentOS and Fedora <= 21)
        * Fedora 24: In order to use `stack setup` on a 32-bit system, you may
          need to run `sudo dnf install ncurses-compat-libs`. If this package is
          not installed, Stack may not be able to install 32-bit GHC versions.
        Also `sudo dnf install ncurses-compat-libs` if you nee
    * Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S make gcc ncurses git gnupg xz zlib gmp libffi zlib`

        * In order to use `stack setup` with older versions of GHC or on a
          32-bit system, you may need the
          [ncurses5-compat-libs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ncurses5-compat-libs/)
          AUR package installed. If this package is not installed, Stack may not
          be able to install older (< 7.10.3) or 32-bit GHC versions.
    * Gentoo users, make sure to have the `ncurses` package with `USE=tinfo` (without it, stack will not be able to install GHC).

* Now you can run `stack` from the terminal.

## FreeBSD

(only 64-bit currently available, tested on FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE)

### Installer script

Run:

    curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

### Manual download

* Install required dependencies:

        pkg install devel/gmake perl5 lang/gcc misc/compat8x misc/compat9x converters/libiconv ca_root_nss

* Download the latest release:

    * [FreeBSD 64-bit](https://www.stackage.org/stack/freebsd-x86_64)

* Extract the archive and place `stack` somewhere on your `$PATH` (see [Path section below](#path))

* Now you can run `stack` from the terminal.

## Path

You can install stack by copying it anywhere on your PATH environment variable. We recommend installing in the same directory where stack itself will install executables (that way stack is able to upgrade itself!). On Windows, that directory is `%APPDATA%\local\bin`, e.g. "c:\Users\Michael\AppData\Roaming\local\bin". For other systems, use `$HOME/.local/bin`.

If you don't have that directory in your PATH, you may need to update your PATH (such as by editing .bashrc).

If you're curious about the choice of these paths, see [issue #153](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/153)

## Shell auto-completion

To get tab-completion of commands on bash, just run the following (or add it to
`.bashrc`):

    eval "$(stack --bash-completion-script stack)"

For more information and other shells, see [the shell auto-completion page](shell_autocompletion.md)

## Upgrade

There are essentially four different approaches to upgrade:

* The `stack` tool itself ships with an `upgrade` command, which download a `stack` binary or build it from source and install it to the default install path (e.g. `~/.local/bin` or `%APPDATA%\local\bin`; see the [Path](#Path) section above). You can use `stack upgrade` to get the latest official release, and `stack upgrade --git` to install from Git and live on the bleeding edge. Make sure the default install directory is on your `PATH` and takes precedence over the system installed `stack`, or copy `stack` from that directory to the system location afterward. For more information, see [this discussion](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/237#issuecomment-126793301).

* If you're using a package manager and are happy with sticking with the officially released binaries from the distribution (which may the lag behind latest version of Stack significantly), simply follow your normal package manager strategies for upgrading (e.g. `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`).

* The get.haskellstack.org script supports the `-f` argument to over-write the current stack executable.  For example:

      curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh -s - -f

  or:

      wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh -s - -f

* Manually follow the steps above to download the newest binaries from the release page and replace the old binary.
