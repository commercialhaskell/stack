# GHCi

`stack ghci` allows you to load components and files of your project into
`ghci`. It uses the same TARGET syntax as `stack build`, and can also take
options like `--test`, `--bench`, and `--flag`.  Similarly to `stack build`, the
default is to load up ghci with all libraries and executables in the project.

In order to load multiple components, `stack ghci` combines all of the ghc options
together.  This doesn't work in the general case, but when the packages being
loaded share similar conventions, it should work out.  A common source of issues
is when one component defines default extensions which aren't assumed by another
component.  For example, specifying `NoImplicitPrelude` in one component but
not another is quite likely to cause failures.  `ghci` will be run with
`-XNoImplicitPrelude`, but it is likely that modules in the other component
assume that the Prelude is implicitly imported.

## Selecting Main module

When loading multiple packages, there may be multiple definitions for the `Main`
module.  You can specify which Main module to load by passing in the
`--main-is TARGET` flag.  If no selection is made and there are multiple `Main`
modules, you will be asked to select from a list of options.

## Speeding up initial load

There are two ways to speed up the initial startup of ghci:

* `--no-build`, to skip an initial build step.  This only works if the
  dependencies have already been built.

* `--no-load`, to skip loading all defined modules into ghci.  You can then
  directly use `:load MyModule` to load a specific module in your project.

## Loading just the main module

By default, `stack ghci` loads and imports all of the modules in the package.
This allows you to easily use anything exported by your package.  This is
usually quite convenient, but in some cases it makes sense to only load one
module, or no modules at all.  The `--only-main` flag allows this.  It specifies
that only the main module will be loaded, if any.  This is particularly useful
in the following circumstances:

1. You're loading the project in order to run it in ghci (e.g. via `main`), and
   you intend to reload while developing.  Without the `--only-main` flag, you
   will need to quit and restart ghci whenever a module gets deleted.  With the
   flag, reloading should work fine in this case.

2. If many of your modules have exports named the same thing, then you'll need to
   refer to them using qualified names.  To avoid this, it may be easier to use
   `--only-main` to start with a blank slate and just import the modules you are
   interested in.

## Loading a filepath directly

Instead of the `TARGET` syntax, it is also possible to directly run
`stack ghci src/MyFile.hs`.  This will figure out which component the file is
associated with, and use the options from that component.

## Specifying extra packages to build / depend on

Sometimes you want to load ghci with an additional package, that isn't a direct
dependency of your components.  This can be achieved by using the `--package` flag.
For example, if I want to experiment with the lens library, I can run
`stack ghci --package lens`.

## Running plain ghci

`stack ghci` always runs ghci configured to load code from packages in your
project.  In particular, this means it passes in flags like `-hide-all-packages`
and `-package-id=` in order to configure which packages are visible to ghci.

For doing experiments which just involve packages installed in your databases,
it may be useful to run ghci plainly like `stack exec ghci`. This will run a
plain `ghci` in an environment which includes `GHC_PACKAGE_PATH`, and so will
have access to your databases.
