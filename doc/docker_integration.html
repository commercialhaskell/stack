<!-- This file exists only to redirect from old Sphinx URLs to new MkDocs URLs.
This is more properly done using an HTTP redirect, but unfortunately
readthedocs.org's page redirection is broken (see
https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1826). Once that bug is fixed,
this file, and its reference in mkdocs.yml, can be removed. -->
