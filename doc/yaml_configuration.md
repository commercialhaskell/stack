# Configuration and customisation

Stack is configured by the content of YAML files. Some Stack operations can also
be customised by the use of scripts.

## YAML configuration

Stack's YAML configuration options break down into
[project-specific](#project-specific-configuration) options and
[non-project-specific](#non-project-specific-configuration) options. They are
configured at the project-level or globally.

The **project-level** configuration file (`stack.yaml`) contains
project-specific options and may contain non-project-specific options. However,
non-project-specific options in the project-level configuration file in the
`global-project` directory (see below) are ignored by Stack.

Stack obtains project-level configuration from one of the following (in order of
preference):

1. A file specified by the `--stack-yaml` command line option.
2. A file specified by the `STACK_YAML` environment variable.
3. A file named `stack.yaml` in the current directory or an ancestor directory.
4. A file name `stack.yaml` in the `global-project` directory in the
   [Stack root](stack_root.md).

The **global** configuration file (`config.yaml`) contains only
non-project-specific options.

Stack obtains global configuration from a file named `config.yaml`. The location
of this file depends on the operating system and whether Stack is configured to
use the XDG Base Directory Specification.

=== "Unix-like"

    `config.yaml` is located in `/etc/stack` (for system-wide options); and/or
    in the [Stack root](stack_root.md) (for user-specific options).

=== "Windows"

    `config.yaml` is located in the [Stack root](stack_root.md).

=== "XDG Base Directory Specification"

    On Unix-like operating systems and Windows, Stack can be configured to
    follow the XDG Base Directory Specification if the environment variable
    `STACK_XDG` is set to any non-empty value. However, Stack will ignore that
    configuration if the [Stack root](stack_root.md) location has been set on
    the command line or the `STACK_ROOT` environment variable exists.

    If Stack is following the XDG Base Directory Specification, the location of
    `config.yaml` (for user-specific options) is `<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/stack`. If
    the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable does not exist, the default is
    `~/.config/stack` on Unix-like operating systems and `%APPDIR%\stack` on
    Windows.

This page is intended to document fully all YAML configuration options. If you
identify any inaccuracies or incompleteness, please update the page, and if
you're not sure how, open an issue labeled "question".

If you wish to understand the difference between a `stack.yaml` files and a
Cabal file (named `<package_name>.cabal`), see the
[stack.yaml vs a Cabal file](stack_yaml_vs_cabal_package_file.md) documentation.

## Project-specific configuration

Project-specific configuration options are valid only in a project-level
configuration file (`stack.yaml`).

> Note: We define **project** to mean a directory that contains a `stack.yaml`
> file, which specifies how to build a set of packages. We define **package** to
> be a package with a Cabal file or an Hpack `package.yaml` file.

In your project-specific options, you specify both **which local packages** to
build and **which dependencies to use** when building these packages. Unlike the
user's local packages, these dependencies aren't built by default. They only get
built when needed.

Shadowing semantics, described
[here](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/v1.5.1/architecture/#shadowing), are
applied to your configuration. So, if you add a package to your `packages` list,
it will be used even if you're using a snapshot that specifies a particular
version. Similarly, `extra-deps` will shadow the version specified in the
resolver.

### resolver or snapshot

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--resolver` option

`resolver` and `snapshot` are synonyms. Only one of these keys is permitted, not
both.

The `resolver` or `snapshot` key specifies which snapshot is to be used for this
project. A snapshot defines a GHC version, a number of packages available for
installation, and various settings like build flags. It is called a resolver
since a snapshot states how dependencies are resolved. There are currently
four resolver types:

* LTS Haskell snapshots, e.g. `resolver: lts-21.16`
* Stackage Nightly snapshots, e.g. `resolver: nightly-2023-09-24`
* No snapshot, just use packages shipped with the compiler. For GHC this looks
  like `resolver: ghc-9.6.2`
* Custom snapshot, via a URL or relative file path. For further information, see
  the [Pantry](pantry.md) documentation.

Each of these resolvers will also determine what constraints are placed on the
compiler version. See the [compiler-check](#compiler-check) option for some
additional control over compiler version.

The `resolver` key corresponds to a Pantry snapshot location. For further
information, see the [Pantry](pantry.md) documentation.

### packages

Default:

~~~yaml
packages:
- .
~~~

The `packages` key specifies a list of packages that are part of your local
project. These are specified via paths to local directories. A path is
considered relative to the directory containing the `stack.yaml` file. For
example, if the `stack.yaml` is located at `/dir1/dir2/stack.yaml`, and has:

~~~yaml
packages:
- my-package
- dir3/my-other-package
~~~

the configuration means "project packages in directories `/dir1/dir2/my-package`
and `/dir1/dir2/dir3/my-other-package`".

The `packages` key is optional. The default value, '`.`', means that the
project has a single package located in the current directory.

Each specified package directory must have a valid Cabal file or Hpack
`package.yaml` file present. Any subdirectories of the directory are not
searched for Cabal files. A subdirectory has to be specified as an independent
item in the list of packages.

A project package is different from a dependency, both a snapshot dependency
(via the [`resolver` or `snapshot`](#resolver-or-snapshot) key) and an
extra-deps dependency (via the [`extra-deps`](#extra-deps) key). For example:

* a project package will be built by default by commanding
  [`stack build`](build_command.md) without specific targets. A dependency will
  only be built if it is depended upon; and
* test suites and benchmarks may be run for a project package. They are never
  run for a dependency.

### extra-deps

Default: `[]`

The `extra-deps` key specifies a list of extra dependencies on top of what is
defined in the snapshot (specified by the
[`resolver` or `snapshot`](#resolver-or-snapshot) key). A dependency may come
from either a Pantry package location or a local file path.

A Pantry package location is one or three different kinds of sources:

* the package index (Hackage);
* an archive (a tarball or zip file, either local or over HTTP or HTTPS); or
* a Git or Mercurial repository.

For further information on the format for specifying a Pantry package location,
see the [Pantry](pantry.md) documentation. For example:

~~~yaml
extra-deps:
# The latest revision of a package in the package index (Hackage):
- acme-missiles-0.3
# A specific revision of a package in the package index (Hackage):
- acme-missiles-0.3@rev:0
# An *.tar.gz archive file over HTTPS:
- url: https://github.com/example-user/my-repo/archive/08c9b4cdf977d5bcd1baba046a007940c1940758.tar.gz
  subdirs:
  - my-package
# A Git repository at a specific commit:
- git: https://github.com/example-user/my-repo.git
  commit: 08c9b4cdf977d5bcd1baba046a007940c1940758
# An archive of files at a point in the history of a GitHub repository
# (identified by a specific commit):
- github: example-user/my-repo
  commit: 08c9b4cdf977d5bcd1baba046a007940c1940758
  subdirs:
  - my-package
~~~

!!! note

    GHC boot packages are special. An extra-dep with the same package name and
    version as a GHC boot package will be ignored.

For a local file path source, the path is considered relative to the directory
containing the `stack.yaml` file. For example, if the `stack.yaml` is located
at `/dir1/dir2/stack.yaml`, and has:

~~~yaml
extra-deps:
- my-package
- dir3/my-other-package
~~~

the configuration means "extra-deps packages in directories
`/dir1/dir2/my-package` and `/dir1/dir2/dir3/my-other-package`".

!!! note

    A local file path that has the format of a package identifier will be
    interpreted as a reference to a package on Hackage. Prefix it with `./` to
    avoid that confusion.

!!! note

    A specified extra-dep that does not have the format of a valid Pantry
    package location (for example, a reference to a package on Hackage that
    omits the package's version) will be interpreted as a local file path.

### flags

Default: `{}`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `stack build --flag` option

Flags can be set for each package separately. For example:

~~~yaml
flags:
  package-name:
    flag-name: true
~~~

If a specified flag is different than the one specified for a snapshot package,
then the snapshot package will automatically be promoted to be an extra-dep.

### drop-packages

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.1.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

Default: `[]`

Packages which, when present in the snapshot specified in `resolver`, should not
be included in our package. This can be used for a few different purposes, e.g.:

* Ensure that packages you don't want used in your project cannot be used in a
  `package.yaml` file (e.g., for license reasons)
* Prevent overriding of a global package like `Cabal`. For more information, see
  Stackage issue
  [#4425](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage/issues/4425)
* When using a custom GHC build, avoid incompatible packages (see this
  [comment](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/4655#issuecomment-477954429)).

~~~yaml
drop-packages:
- Cabal
- buggy-package
- package-with-unacceptable-license
~~~

### user-message

If present, specifies a message to be displayed every time the configuration is
loaded by Stack. It can serve as a reminder for the user to review the
configuration and make any changes if needed. The user can delete this message
if the generated configuration is acceptable.

For example, a user-message is inserted by `stack init` when it omits packages
or adds external dependencies, namely:

~~~yaml
user-message: ! 'Warning: Some packages were found to be incompatible with the resolver
  and have been left commented out in the packages section.

  Warning: Specified resolver could not satisfy all dependencies. Some external packages
  have been added as dependencies.

  You can omit this message by removing it from stack.yaml

'
~~~

### custom-preprocessor-extensions

Default: `[]`

Command line equivalent: `--customer-preprocessor-extensions` option

In order for Stack to be aware of any custom preprocessors you are using, add
their extensions here

~~~yaml
custom-preprocessor-extensions:
- erb
~~~

TODO: Add a simple example of how to use custom preprocessors.

### extra-package-dbs

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.6.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.6.0)

Default: `[]`

A list of relative or absolute paths to package databases. These databases will
be added on top of GHC's global package database before the addition of other
package databases.

!!! warning

    Use of this feature may result in builds that are not reproducible, as Stack
    has no control over the contents of the extra package databases.

## Non-project-specific configuration

Non-project configuration options can be included in a project-level
configuration file (`stack.yaml`) or in global configuration files
(`config.yaml`). However, non-project-specific options in the project-level
configuration file in the `global-project` directory are ignored by Stack. The
options below are listed in alphabetic order.

### allow-different-user

[:octicons-tag-24: 1.0.1.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.0.1.0)

Restrictions: POSIX systems only.

Default: `false`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--[no-]allow-different-user` flag

Allow users other than the owner of the [Stack root](stack_root.md) to use the
Stack installation.

~~~yaml
allow-different-user: true
~~~

The intention of this option is to prevent file permission problems, for example
as the result of a Stack command executed under `sudo`.

The option is automatically enabled when Stack is re-spawned in a Docker
process.

### allow-newer

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.8.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.8.0)

Default: `false`

Whether to ignore version bounds in Cabal files. This also ignores lower bounds.
The name `allow-newer` is chosen to match the commonly-used Cabal option.


~~~yaml
allow-newer: true
~~~

### allow-newer-deps

:octicons-beaker-24: Experimental

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.9.3](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.9.3)

Default: `none`

Determines a subset of packages to which `allow-newer` should apply. This option
has no effect (but warns) if `allow-newer` is `false`.

~~~yaml
allow-newer-deps:
  - foo
  - bar
~~~

### apply-ghc-options

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.6.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.6.0)

Default: `locals`

Related command line:
[`stack build --ghc-options`](build_command.md#-ghc-options-option) option

Determines to which packages any GHC command line options specified on the
command line are applied. Possible values are: `everything` (all packages, local
or otherwise), `locals` (all local packages, targets or otherwise), and
`targets` (all local packages that are targets).

!!! note

    The use of `everything` can break invariants about your snapshot database.

!!! note

    Before Stack 0.1.6.0, the default value was `targets`.

### apply-prog-options

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.11.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.11.1)

Default: `locals`

Related command line:
[`stack build --PROG-option`](build_command.md#-prog-option-options) options

Determines to which packages all and any `--PROG-option` command line options
specified on the command line are applied. Possible values are: `everything`
(all packages, local or otherwise), `locals` (all local packages, targets or
otherwise), and `targets` (all local packages that are targets).

!!! note

    The use of `everything` can break invariants about your snapshot database.

### arch

Default: The machine architecture on which Stack is running.

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--arch` option

Stack identifies different GHC executables by platform (operating system and
machine architecture), (optional) GHC variant and (optional) GHC build.
See [`setup-info`](#setup-info).

`arch` sets the machine architecture. Values are those recognized by Cabal,
including `x86_64`, `i386` and `aarch64`.

### build

[:octicons-tag-24: 1.1.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

Default:

~~~yaml
build:
  library-profiling: false
  executable-profiling: false
  copy-bins: false
  prefetch: false
  keep-going: false
  keep-tmp-files: false
  # NOTE: global usage of haddock can cause build failures when documentation is
  # incorrectly formatted.  This could also affect scripts which use Stack.
  haddock: false
  haddock-arguments:

    # Additional arguments passed to haddock. The corresponding command line
    # option is --haddock-arguments. Example of use:
    #
    # haddock-args:
    # - "--css=/home/user/my-css"
    haddock-args: []

  # The corresponding command line flag is --[no-]open.
  open-haddocks: false

  # If Stack is configured to build Haddock documentation, defaults to true.
  haddock-deps: false

  # If specified, implies haddock-internal: false and
  # haddock-hyperlink-source: true. Since Stack UNRELEASED.
  haddock-for-hackage: false

  # The configuration is ignored, if haddock-for-hackage: true.
  haddock-internal: false

  # The configuration is ignored, if haddock-for-hackage: true.
  haddock-hyperlink-source: true

  # These are inadvisable to use in your global configuration, as they make the
  # Stack build command line behave quite differently.
  test: false
  test-arguments:
    rerun-tests: true   # Rerun successful tests

    # The corresponding command line option is --test-arguments. Example of use:
    #
    # additional-args:
    # - "--fail-fast"
    additional-args: []
    coverage: false
    no-run-tests: false
  bench: false
  benchmark-opts:

    # Example of use:
    #
    # benchmark-arguments: "--csv bench.csv"
    benchmark-arguments: ""
    no-run-benchmarks: false
  force-dirty: false
  reconfigure: false
  cabal-verbose: false
  split-objs: false

  # Since Stack 1.8. Starting with Stack 2.0, the default is true
  interleaved-output: true
  # Since Stack 2.13.1. Available options are none, count-only, capped and full.
  progress-bar: capped
  # Since Stack 1.10.
  ddump-dir: ""
~~~

Command line equivalents (take precedence): Yes, see below.

Allows setting build options which are usually specified on the command line.

The meanings of these settings correspond directly with the command line flags
of the same name. For further information, see the
[`stack build` command](build_command.md) documentation and the
[users guide](GUIDE.md#the-build-command).

### casa

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.13.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.13.1)

Default:

~~~yaml
casa:
  enable: true # Use a Casa server?
  repo-prefix: https://casa.fpcomplete.com # Unless casa-repo-prefix is set.
  max-keys-per-request: 1280 # Maximum number of keys per request.
~~~

This option specifies whether or not Stack should use a Casa
(content-addressable storage archive) server to cache Cabal files and all other
files in packages; and, if so, the prefix for the URL used to pull information
from the server and the maximum number of keys per request. For further
information, see this blog post about
[Casa and Stack](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/casa-and-stack/).

`repo-prefix` replaces [`casa-repo-prefix`](#casa-repo-prefix) (which is
deprecated) and has precedence if both keys are set.

### casa-repo-prefix

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.3.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.3.1)

Deprecated in favour of [`casa`](#casa), which takes precedence if present.

Default: `https://casa.fpcomplete.com`

This option specifies the prefix for the URL used to pull information from the
Casa server.

### color

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--color` option

This option specifies when to use color in output. The option is used as
`color: <WHEN>`, where `<WHEN>` is 'always', 'never', or 'auto'. On Windows
versions before Windows 10, for terminals that do not support color codes, the
default is 'never'; color may work on terminals that support color codes.

(The British English spelling (colour) is also accepted. In yaml configuration
files, the American spelling is the alternative that has priority.)

### compiler

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.8.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.8.0)

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--compiler` option

Overrides the compiler version in the resolver. Note that the `compiler-check`
flag also applies to the version numbers. This uses the same syntax as compiler
resolvers like `ghc-9.6.2`. This can be used to override the
compiler for a Stackage snapshot, like this:

~~~yaml
resolver: lts-21.16
compiler: ghc-9.6.2
compiler-check: match-exact
~~~

#### Building GHC from source

:octicons-beaker-24: Experimental

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.1.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

Stack supports building the GHC compiler from source, using
[Hadrian](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/blob/master/hadrian/README.md) (the
build system for GHC). The GHC version to build and to use is defined by a a Git
commit ID and a Hadrian "flavour", with the following syntax:

~~~yaml
compiler: ghc-git-<commit_id>-<Hadrian_flavour>
~~~

In the following example the commit ID is "5be7ad..." and the flavour is
"quick":

~~~yaml
compiler: ghc-git-5be7ad7861c8d39f60b7101fd8d8e816ff50353a-quick
~~~

By default, the code is retrieved from the main GHC repository. If you want to
select another repository, use the `compiler-repository` option:

~~~yaml
compiler-repository: git://my/ghc/repository
# default
# compiler-repository: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc.git
~~~

Stack does not check the compiler version when it uses a compiler built from
source. It is assumed that the built compiler is recent enough as Stack doesn't
enable any known workaround to make older compilers work.

Building the compiler can take a very long time (more than one hour). For faster
build times, use Hadrian flavours that disable documentation generation.

#### Bootstrap compiler

Building GHC from source requires a working GHC (known as the bootstrap
compiler). As we use a Stack based version of Hadrian (`hadrian/build-stack` in
GHC sources), the bootstrap compiler is configured into `hadrian/stack.yaml` and
fully managed by Stack.

!!! note

    For some commit IDs, the resolver specified in `hadrian/stack.yaml`
    specifies a version of GHC that cannot be used to build GHC. This results in
    GHC's `configure` script reporting messages similar to the following before
    aborting:

    ~~~text
    checking version of ghc... 9.0.2
    configure: error: GHC version 9.2 or later is required to compile GHC.
    ~~~

    The resolution is: (1) to specify an alternative resolver (one that
    specifies a sufficiently recent version of GHC) on the command line, using
    Stack's option `--resolver <resolver>`. Stack will use that resolver when
    running GHC's `configure` script; and (2) to set the contents of the `STACK`
    environment variable to be `stack --resolver <resolver>`. Hadrian's
    `build-stack` script wil refer to that environment variable for the Stack
    command it uses.

#### Hadrian prerequisites

The Hadrian build system has certain
[prerequisites](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building/preparation).
It requires certain versions of the `happy` and `alex` executables on the PATH.
Stack will build and install `happy` and `alex`, if not already on the PATH.

=== "macOS"

    Hadrian requires, or case use, certain tools or Python packages that do not
    come with macOS by default and that need to be installed using `brew` or
    `pip3` (Python). Hadrian's LaTeX documentation also requires the
    [DejaVu fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) to be installed.

    ~~~zsh
    brew install python@3.11
    # GHC uses a Python script named `boot`.
    brew install automake
    # Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles.
    brew install texinfo
    # Official documentation format of the GNU project.
    pip3 install -U sphinx
    # Sphinx is the Python documentation generator.
    brew install --cask mactex
    # MacTeX: Full TeX Live distribution with GUI applications
    ~~~

=== "Windows"

    Hadrian requires, or can use, certain MSYS2 or Python packages that do not
    come with the Stack-supplied MSYS2 by default and need to be installed
    using `pacman` (MSYS2) or `pip` (Python). Hadrian's LaTeX documentation also
    requires the [DejaVu fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) to be
    installed.

    ~~~pwsh
    stack exec -- pacman --sync --refresh
    # Synchronize MSYS2 package databases
    stack exec -- pacman --sync mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pip
    # The PyPA recommended tool (pip) for installing Python packages. Also
    # installs Python as a dependency. GHC uses a Python script named `boot`.
    # The package must be the one from the `mingw64` MSYS2 repository, as Python
    # from the `msys` repository cannot interpret Windows file paths correctly.
    stack exec -- pacman --sync mingw-w64-x86_64-autotools
    # The GNU autotools build system, including `autoreconf`, `aclocal`
    # and `make`. GHC uses a sh script named `configure` which is itself created
    # from a file named `configure.ac`.
    stack exec -- pacman --sync patch
    # A utility to apply patch files to original sources.
    stack exec -- pacman --sync texinfo
    # Utilities to work with and produce manuals, ASCII text, and on-line
    # documentation from a single source file, including `makeinfo`.
    stack exec -- pacman --sync mingw-w64-x86_64-ca-certificates
    # Common CA (certificate authority) certificates.
    stack exec -- pip install -U sphinx
    # Sphinx is the Python documentation generator.
    ~~~

    Hadrian may require certain LaTeX packages and may prompt for these to be
    installed duing the build process.

#### Global packages

The GHC compiler you build from sources may depend on unreleased versions of
some global packages (e.g. Cabal). It may be an issue if a package you try to
build with this compiler depends on such global packages because Stack may not
be able to find versions of those packages (on Hackage, etc.) that are
compatible with the compiler.

The easiest way to deal with this issue is to drop the offending packages as
follows. Instead of using the packages specified in the resolver, the global
packages bundled with GHC will be used.

~~~yaml
drop-packages:
- Cabal
- ...
~~~

Another way to deal with this issue is to add the relevant packages as
`extra-deps` built from source. To avoid mismatching versions, you can use
exactly the same commit id you used to build GHC as follows:

~~~
extra-deps:
- git: https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc.git
  commit: 5be7ad7861c8d39f60b7101fd8d8e816ff50353a
  subdirs:
    - libraries/Cabal/Cabal
    - libraries/...
~~~

### compiler-check

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.4.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.4.0)

Default: `match-minor`

Specifies how the compiler version in the resolver is matched against concrete
versions. Valid values:

* `match-minor`: make sure that the first three components match, but allow
  patch-level differences. For example< 7.8.4.1 and 7.8.4.2 would both match
  7.8.4. This is useful to allow for custom patch levels of a compiler.
* `match-exact`: the entire version number must match precisely
* `newer-minor`: the third component can be increased, e.g. if your resolver is
  `ghc-7.10.1`, then 7.10.2 will also be allowed. This was the default up
  through Stack 0.1.3

### concurrent-tests

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.2.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.2.0)

Default: `true`

This option specifies whether test suites should be executed concurrently with
each other. The default is `true` since this is usually fine and it often means
that tests can complete earlier. However, if some test suites require exclusive
access to some resource, or require a great deal of CPU or memory resources,
then it makes sense to set this to `false`.

~~~yaml
concurrent-tests: false
~~~

### configure-options

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.1.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

Related command line (takes precedence):
[`stack build --PROG-option`](build_command.md#prog-option-options) options

`configure-options` can specify Cabal (the library) options (including
`--PROG-option` or `--PROG-options` options) for the configure step of the Cabal
build process for a named package, all local packages that are targets (using
the `$targets` key), all local packages (targets or otherwise) (using the
`$locals` key), or all packages (local or otherwise) (using the `$everything`
key).

~~~yaml
configure-options:
  $everything:
  - --with-gcc
  - /some/path
  $locals:
  - --happy-option=--ghc
  my-package:
  - --another-flag
~~~

### connection-count

Default: `8`

Integer indicating how many simultaneous downloads are allowed to happen.

### default-template

Default: `new-template` in the
[stack-templates](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates/)
repository.

This option specifies which template to use with `stack new`, when none is
specified. Other templates are listed in the
[stack-templates](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates/)
repository. See the output of `stack templates`.

### docker

Command line equivalents: `--docker-*` flags and options (see
`stack --docker-help` for details).

For further information, see the
[Docker integration](docker_integration.md#configuration) documentation.

### dump-logs

[:octicons-tag-24: 1.3.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

Default: `warning`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--[no-]dump-logs` flag

In the case of *non-interleaved* output and *more than one* target package,
Stack sends the build output from GHC for each target package to a log file,
unless an error occurs that prevents that. For further information, see the
[`stack build --[no-]interleaved-output` flag](build_command.md#-no-interleaved-output-flag)
documentation.

The value of the `dump-logs` key controls what, if any, log file content is sent
('dumped') to the standard error stream of the console at the end of the build.
Possible values are:

~~~yaml
dump-logs: none    # don't dump the content of any log files
dump-logs: warning # dump the content of any log files that include GHC warnings
dump-logs: all     # dump the content of all log files
~~~

At the command line, `--no-dump-logs` is equivalent to `dump-logs: none` and
`--dump-logs` is equivalent to `dump-logs: all`.

If GHC reports an error during the build and a log file is created, that build
output will be included in the log file. Stack will also report errors during
building to the standard error stream. That stream can be piped to a file. For
example, for a file named `stderr.log`:

~~~text
stack --no-dump-logs --color always build --no-interleaved-output 2> stderr.log
~~~

### extra-include-dirs

Default: `[]`

Command line equivalent: `--extra-include-dirs` option (repeat for each
directory)

A list of extra paths to be searched for header files. Paths should be absolute

~~~yaml
extra-include-dirs:
- /opt/foo/include
~~~

Since these are system-dependent absolute paths, it is recommended that you
specify these in your `config.yaml` file. If you control the build environment
in your project's ``stack.yaml``, perhaps through docker or other means, then it
may well make sense to include these there as well.

### extra-lib-dirs

Default: `[]`

Command line equivalent: `--extra-lib-dirs` option (repeat for each directory)

A list of extra paths to be searched for libraries. Paths should be absolute

~~~yaml
extra-lib-dirs:
- /opt/foo/lib
~~~

Since these are system-dependent absolute paths, it is recommended that you
specify these in your `config.yaml` file. If you control the build environment
in your project's ``stack.yaml``, perhaps through Docker or other means, then it
may well make sense to include these there as well.

### extra-path

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.4.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.4.0)

This option specifies additional directories to prepend to the PATH. These will
be used when resolving the location of executables, and will also be visible in
the PATH of processes run by Stack.

For example, to prepend `/path-to-some-dep/bin` to your PATH:

~~~yaml
extra-path:
- /path-to-some-dep/bin
~~~

Other paths added by Stack - things like the project's binary directory and the
compiler's binary directory - will take precedence over those specified here
(the automatic paths get prepended).

### ghc-build

[:octicons-tag-24: 1.3.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

Default: `standard`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--ghc-build` option

Stack identifies different GHC executables by platform (operating system and
machine architecture), (optional) GHC variant and (optional) GHC build.
See [`setup-info`](#setup-info).

`ghc-build` specifies a specialized architecture for the GHC executable.
Normally this is determined automatically, but it can be overridden. Possible
arguments include `standard`, `gmp4`, `nopie`, `tinfo6`, `tinfo6-libc6-pre232`,
`tinfo6-nopie`, `ncurses6`, `int-native` and `integersimple`.

### ghc-options

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.4.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.4.0)

Default: `{}`

Related command line (takes precedence):
[`stack build --ghc-options`](build_command.md#ghc-options-option) option

`ghc-options` can specify GHC command line options for a named package, all
local packages that are targets (using the `$targets` key), all local packages
(targets or otherwise) (using the `$locals` key), or all packages (local or
otherwise) (using the `$everything` key).

~~~yaml
ghc-options:
  "$everything": -O2
  "$locals": -Wall
  "$targets": -Werror
  some-package: -DSOME_CPP_FLAG
~~~

GHC's command line options are _order-dependent_ and evaluated from left to
right. Later options can override earlier options. Stack applies options (as
applicable) in the order of `$everything`, `$locals`, `$targets`, and then those
for the named package. Any existing GHC command line options of a package are
applied after those specified in Stack's YAML configuration.

Since Stack 1.6.1, setting a GHC options for a specific package will
automatically promote it to a local package (much like setting a custom package
flag). However, setting options via `$everything` on all flags will not do so
(see
[GitHub discussion](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/849#issuecomment-320892095)
for reasoning). This can lead to unpredictable behavior by affecting your
snapshot packages.

!!! note

    Before Stack 1.6.1, the key `*` (then deprecated) had the same function as
    the key `$everything`.

### ghc-variant

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.5.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.5.0)

Default: `standard`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--ghc-variant` option

Stack identifies different GHC executables by platform (operating system and
machine architecture), (optional) GHC variant and (optional) GHC build.
See [`setup-info`](#setup-info).

`ghc-variant` specifies a variant of the GHC executable. Known values are:

* `standard`: Use the standard GHC binary distribution
* `int-native`: From GHC 9.4.1, use a GHC bindist that uses the Haskell-native
   big-integer
  [backend](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.0.2/docs/html/users_guide/9.0.1-notes.html#highlights).
  For further information, see this [article](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/07/28/improving-haskells-big-numbers-support/).
* `integersimple`: Use a GHC bindist that uses
  [integer-simple instead of GMP](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/ReplacingGMPNotes)
* any other value: Use a custom GHC bindist. You should specify
  [setup-info](#setup-info) or [setup-info-locations](#setup-info-locations)
  so `stack setup` knows where to download it,
  or pass the `stack setup --ghc-bindist` argument on the command-line

This option is incompatible with `system-ghc: true`.

### hackage-base-url

[:octicons-tag-24: 1.9.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.9.1)

Default: `https://hackage.haskell.org/`

Sets the address of the Hackage server to upload the package to.

~~~yaml
hackage-base-url: https://hackage.example.com/
~~~

### hide-source-paths

Default: `true`
([:octicons-tag-24: 2.1.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.1.1))

Whether to use the `-fhide-source-paths` option by default for GHC >= 8.2:

~~~yaml
hide-source-paths: false
~~~

Build output when enabled:

~~~text
...
[1 of 2] Compiling Lib
[2 of 2] Compiling Paths_test_pr
...
~~~

Build output when disabled:

~~~text
...
[1 of 2] Compiling Lib              ( src/Lib.hs, .stack-work/dist/x86_64-linux-tinfo6/Cabal-2.4.0.1/build/Lib.o )
...
~~~

### hide-th-loading

Default: `true`

Strip out the "Loading ..." lines from GHC build output, produced when using
Template Haskell.

### ignore-revision-mismatch

(Removed 1.11)

This flag was introduced in Stack 1.6, and removed on the move to Pantry. You
will receive a warning if this configuration value is set.

### install-ghc

Default: `true`
([:octicons-tag-24: 1.5.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.5.0))

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--[no-]install-ghc` flag

Whether or not to automatically install GHC when necessary.

### jobs

Default: the number of CPUs (cores) that the machine has.

Command line equivalent (takes precedence):
[`-j`, `--jobs` option](global_flags.md#-jobs-or-j-option)

Specifies the number of concurrent jobs (principally, Stack actions during
building - see further below) to run.

When [building GHC from source](#building-ghc-from-source), specifies the
`-j[<n>]` flag of GHC's Hadrian build system.

In some circumstances, the default can cause some machines to run out of memory
during building. If those circumstances arise, specify `jobs: 1`.

This configuration option is distinct from GHC's own `-j[<n>]` flag, which
relates to parallel compilation of modules within a package.

### local-bin-path

Default (on Unix-like operating systems): `~/.local/bin`

Default (on Windows): `%APPDATA%\local\bin`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--local-bin-path` option

Specifies the target directory for
[`stack build --copy-bins`](build_command.md#-no-copy-bins-flag) and
`stack install`. An absolute or relative path can be specified.

If the project-level configuration is provided in the `global-project` directory
in the [Stack root](stack_root.md), a relative path is assumed to be relative to
the current directory. Otherwise, it is assumed to be relative to the directory
of the project-level configuration file.

### local-programs-path

[:octicons-tag-24: 1.3.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

This overrides the location of the Stack 'programs' directory, where tools like
GHC get installed. The path must be an absolute one.

Stack's defaults differ between Unix-like operating systems and Windows.

=== "Unix-like"

    Default: `programs` directory in the [Stack root](stack_root.md).

=== "Windows"

    Default: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\stack`, if the `%LOCALAPPDATA%`
    environment variable exists. Otherwise, the `programs` directory in the
    [Stack root](stack_root.md).

    The MSYS2 tool is also installed in the Stack 'programs' directory.

    !!! warning

        If there is a space character in the path to Stack's 'programs'
        directory this may cause problems with building packages that make use
        of the GNU project's `autoconf` package and `configure` shell script
        files. That may be the case particularly if there is no corresponding
        short name ('8 dot 3' name) for the directory in the path with the space
        (which may be the case if '8 dot 3' names have been stripped or their
        creation not enabled by default). If there are problems building, it
        will be necessary to specify an alternative path that does not contain
        space characters. Examples of packages on Hackage that make use of
        `configure` are `network` and `process`.

### modify-code-page

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.6.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.6.0)

Restrictions: Windows systems only.

Default: `true`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--[no-]modify-code-page` flag

Whether to modify the code page for UTF-8 output.

~~~yaml
modify-code-page: false
~~~

### nix

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.10.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.10.0)

Default:

~~~yaml
nix:
  enable: false # Except on NixOS, where `enable: true`
  pure: true
  packages: []
  shell-file:
  nix-shell-options: []
  path: []
  add-gc-roots: false
~~~

Command line equivalents: `--nix-*` flags and options (see `stack --nix-help`
for details).

For further information, see the
[Nix integration](nix_integration.md#configuration) documentation.

### notify-if-cabal-untested

:octicons-tag-24: UNRELEASED

Default: `true`

If Stack has not been tested with the version of Cabal (the library) that has
been found, should Stack notify the user of that?

### notify-if-ghc-untested

:octicons-tag-24: UNRELEASED

Default: `true`

If Stack has not been tested with the version of GHC that is being used, should
Stack notify the user of that?

### notify-if-nix-on-path

:octicons-tag-24: UNRELEASED

Default: `true`

If Stack's integration with the Nix package manager is not enabled, should Stack
notify the user if a `nix` executable is on the PATH?

### package-index

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.9.3](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.9.3)

Default:

~~~yaml
package-index:
  download-prefix: https://hackage.haskell.org/
  hackage-security:
    keyids:
    - 0a5c7ea47cd1b15f01f5f51a33adda7e655bc0f0b0615baa8e271f4c3351e21d
    - 1ea9ba32c526d1cc91ab5e5bd364ec5e9e8cb67179a471872f6e26f0ae773d42

    - 51f0161b906011b52c6613376b1ae937670da69322113a246a09f807c62f6921
    - fe331502606802feac15e514d9b9ea83fee8b6ffef71335479a2e68d84adc6b0
    key-threshold: 3
    ignore-expiry: true
~~~

Takes precedence over the `package-indices` key, which is deprecated.

Specify the package index. The index must use the
[Hackage Security](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hackage-security) format.
This setting is most useful for providing a mirror of the official Hackage
server for

* bypassing a firewall; or
* faster downloads.

If the setting specifies an index that does not mirror Hackage, it is likely
that will result in significant breakage, including most snapshots failing to
work.

In the case of Hackage, the keys of its root key holders are contained in the
`haskell-infra/hackage-root-keys`
[repository](https://github.com/haskell-infra/hackage-root-keys). The Hackage
package index is signed. A signature is valid when three key holders have
signed. The Hackage timestamp is also signed. A signature is valid when one key
holder has signed.

If the `hackage-security` key is absent, the Hackage Security configuration will
default to that for the official Hackage server.

`key-threshold` specifies the minimum number of keyholders that must have signed
the package index for it to be considered valid.

`ignore-expiry` specifies whether or not the expiration of timestamps should be
ignored.

### package-indices

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.1.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

Deprecated in favour of [`package-index`](#package-index), which takes
precedence if present.

Default:

~~~yaml
package-indices:
- download-prefix: https://hackage.haskell.org/
  hackage-security:
    keyids:
    - 0a5c7ea47cd1b15f01f5f51a33adda7e655bc0f0b0615baa8e271f4c3351e21d
    - 1ea9ba32c526d1cc91ab5e5bd364ec5e9e8cb67179a471872f6e26f0ae773d42
    - 2c6c3627bd6c982990239487f1abd02e08a02e6cf16edb105a8012d444d870c3
    - 51f0161b906011b52c6613376b1ae937670da69322113a246a09f807c62f6921
    - fe331502606802feac15e514d9b9ea83fee8b6ffef71335479a2e68d84adc6b0
    key-threshold: 3
    ignore-expiry: true
~~~

!!! note

    Before Stack 2.1.3, the default for `ignore-expiry` was `false`. For more
    information, see
    [issue #4928](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/4928).

!!! note

    Before Stack 2.1.1, Stack had a different approach to `package-indices`. For
    more information, see
    [issue #4137](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/4137).

Specify the package index. For further information, see the `package-index`
[documentation](#package-index).

### pvp-bounds

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.5.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.5.0)

Default: `none`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `stack sdist --pvp-bounds` option or
`stack upload --pvp-bounds` option

!!! warning

    As of Stack 1.6.0, this feature does not reliably work, due to issues with
    the Cabal library's printer. Stack will generate a warning when a lossy
    conversion occurs, in which case you may need to disable this setting. For
    further information, see issue
    [#3550](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/3550).

When using the `sdist` and `upload` commands, this setting determines whether
the Cabal file's dependencies should be modified to reflect PVP lower and upper
bounds.

#### Basic use

Values are `none` (unchanged), `upper` (add upper bounds), `lower` (add
lower bounds), and both (and upper and lower bounds). The algorithm Stack
follows is:

* If an upper or lower bound (other than `>= 0` - 'any version') already exists
  on a dependency, it is left alone
* When adding a lower bound, Stack looks at the current version specified by
  `stack.yaml`, and sets it as the lower bound (e.g., `foo >= 1.2.3`)
* When adding an upper bound, Stack sets it as less than the next major version
  (e.g., `foo < 1.3`)

~~~yaml
pvp-bounds: none
~~~

For further information, see the announcement
[blog post](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/09/stack-pvp).

#### Use with Cabal file revisions

[:octicons-tag-24: 1.5.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

Each of the values listed above supports adding `-revision` to the end of the
value, e.g. `pvp-bounds: both-revision`. This means that, when uploading to
Hackage, Stack will first upload your tarball with an unmodified Cabal file, and
then upload a Cabal file revision with the PVP bounds added.

This can be useful - especially combined with the
[Stackage no-revisions feature](http://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/04/stackages-no-revisions-field) -
as a method to ensure PVP compliance without having to proactively fix bounds
issues for Stackage maintenance.

### recommend-stack-upgrade

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.1.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

Default: `true`

When Stack notices that a new version of Stack is available, should it notify
the user?

### rebuild-ghc-options

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.6.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.6.0)

Default: `false`

Should Stack rebuild a package when its GHC options change?

The default value reflects that, in most cases, GHC options are used to affect
optimization levels and warning behavior, for which GHC does not recompile the
modules.

!!! note

    Before Stack 0.1.6.0, Stack rebuilt a package when its GHC options changed.

### require-stack-version

Default: `"-any"`

Require a version of Stack within the specified range
([cabal-style](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/developing-packages.html#build-information))
to be used for this project. Example: `require-stack-version: "== 0.1.*"`

### save-hackage-creds

[:octicons-tag-24: 1.5.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

Default: `true`

Controls whether, when using `stack upload`, the user's Hackage username and
password are stored in a local file.

~~~yaml
save-hackage-creds: true
~~~

### setup-info

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.5.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.5.0)

The `setup-info` dictionary specifies download locations for tools to be
installed during set-up, such as GHC or, on Windows, 7z and MSYS2. The
dictionary maps `('Tool', 'Platform', 'Version')` to the location where it can
be obtained. For example, mapping `(GHC, 64-bit Windows, 9.2.3)` to the URL
hosting the archive file for GHC's installation.

Possible usages of this configuration option are:

1. Using Stack offline or behind a firewall.
2. Extending the tools known to Stack, such as cutting-edge versions of GHC or
   builds for custom Linux distributions (for use with the
   [ghc-variant](#ghc-variant) option).

By default, Stack obtains the dictionary from
[stack-setup-2.yaml](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-content/raw/master/stack/stack-setup-2.yaml).

The `setup-info` dictionary is constructed in the following order:

1. `setup-info` in the YAML configuration - inline configuration
2. `--setup-info-yaml` command line arguments - URLs or paths. Multiple
   locations may be specified.
3. `setup-info-locations` in the YAML configuration - URLs or paths. See further
   below.

The format of this key is the same as in the default
[stack-setup-2.yaml](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-content/raw/master/stack/stack-setup-2.yaml).
For example, GHC 9.2.3 of custom variant `myvariant` (see further below) on
64-bit Windows:

~~~yaml
setup-info:
  ghc:
    windows64-custom-myvariant:
      9.2.3:
        url: "https://example.com/ghc-9.2.3-x86_64-unknown-mingw32-myvariant.tar.xz"
~~~

'Platforms' are pairs of an operating system and a machine architecture (for
example, 32-bit i386 or 64-bit x86-64) (represented by the
`Cabal.Distribution.Systems.Platform` type). Stack currently (version 2.13.1)
supports the following pairs in the format of the `setup-info` key:

|Operating system|I386 arch|X86_64 arch|Other machine architectures                                 |
|----------------|---------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
|Linux           |linux32  |linux64    |AArch64: linux-aarch64, Arm: linux-armv7, Sparc: linux-sparc|
|OSX             |macosx   |macosx     |                                                            |
|Windows         |windows32|windows64  |                                                            |
|FreeBSD         |freebsd32|freebsd64  |AArch64: freebsd-aarch64                                    |
|OpenBSD         |openbsd32|openbsd64  |                                                            |

For GHC, the distinguishing 'Version' in the key format includes a 'tag' for
any (optional) GHC variant (see [ghc-variant](#ghc-variant)) and a further 'tag'
for any (optional) specialised GHC build (see [ghc-build](#ghc-build)).

The optional variant 'tag' is either `-integersimple` or
`-custom-<custom_variant_name>`.

For example, for GHC 9.0.2 of specialised GHC build `tinfo6` on x86_64 Linux:
~~~yaml
setup-info:
  ghc:
    linux64-tinfo6:

On Windows, the required 7z executable and DLL tools are represented in the
format of the `setup-info` key simply by `sevenzexe-info` and `sevenzdll-info`.

This configuration **adds** the specified setup information metadata to the
default. Specifying this configuration **does not** prevent the default
[stack-setup-2.yaml](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-content/raw/master/stack/stack-setup-2.yaml)
from being consulted as a fallback. If, however, you need to **replace** the
default `setup-info` dictionary, use the following:

~~~yaml
setup-info-locations: []
~~~

### setup-info-locations

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.3.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.3.1)

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--setup-info-yaml` option

By way of introduction, see the [`setup-info`](#setup-info) option. This option
specifies the location(s) of `setup-info` dictionaries.

The first location which provides a dictionary that specifies the location of a
tool - `('Tool', 'Platform', 'Version')` - takes precedence. For example, you
can extend the default tools, with a fallback to the default `setup-info`
location, as follows:

~~~yaml
setup-info-locations:
- C:/stack-offline/my-stack-setup.yaml
- relative/inside/my/project/setup-info.yaml
- \\smbShare\stack\my-stack-setup.yaml
- http://stack-mirror.com/stack-setup.yaml
# Fallback to the default location
- https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-content/raw/master/stack/stack-setup-2.yaml
~~~

Stack only refers to the default `setup-info` location if no locations are
specified in the `setup-info-locations` configuration or on the command line
using the `--setup-info-yaml` option.

For example, both of the following will cause `stack setup` not to consult the
default `setup-info` location:

~~~yaml
setup-info-locations:
- C:/stack-offline/my-stack-setup.yaml
~~~

and

~~~yaml
setup-info-locations: []
~~~

Relative paths are resolved relative to the `stack.yaml` file (either the one in
the local project or the global `stack.yaml`).

Relative paths may also be used for the installation paths to tools (such as GHC
or 7z). This allows vendoring the tools inside a monorepo (a single repository
storing many projects). For example:

Directory structure:

~~~text
- src/
- installs/
  - my-stack-setup.yaml
  - 7z.exe
  - 7z.dll
  - ghc-9.2.3.tar.xz
- stack.yaml
~~~

In the project's `stack.yaml`:

~~~yaml
setup-info-locations:
- installs/my-stack-setup.yaml
~~~

In `installs/my-stack-setup.yaml`:

~~~yaml
sevenzexe-info:
  url: "installs/7z.exe"

sevenzdll-info:
  url: "installs/7z.dll"

ghc:
  windows64:
    9.2.3:
      url: "installs/ghc-9.2.3.tar.xz"
~~~

### skip-ghc-check

Default: `false`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--[no-]skip-ghc-check` flag

Should we skip the check to confirm that your system GHC version (on the PATH)
matches what your project expects?

### skip-msys

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.2.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.2.0)

Restrictions: Windows systems only

Default: `false`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--[no-]skip-msys` flag

Skips checking for and installing MSYS2 when stack is Setting up the
environment. This usually doesn't make sense in project-level configurations,
just in `config.yaml`.

~~~yaml
skip-msys: true
~~~

### snapshot-location-base

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.5.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.5.1)

Default: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/commercialhaskell/stackage-snapshots/master/
(as set in the `pantry` library)

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--snapshot-location-base` option

Sets the base location of the LTS Haskell or Stackage Nightly snapshots.

For example:

~~~yaml
snapshot-location-base: https://example.com/snapshots/location/
~~~

has the following effect:

* `lts-X.Y` expands to `https://example.com/snapshots/location/lts/X/Y.yaml`
* `nightly-YYYY-MM-DD` expands to
  `https://example.com/snapshots/location/nightly/YYYY/M/D.yaml`

This key is convenient in setups that restrict access to GitHub, for instance
closed corporate setups. In this setting, it is common for the development
environment to have general access to the internet, but not for testing/building
environments. To avoid the firewall, one can run a local snapshots mirror and
then use a custom `snapshot-location-base` in the closed environments only.

### stack-colors

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--stack-colors` option

Stack uses styles to format some of its output. The default styles do not work
well with every terminal theme. This option specifies Stack's output styles,
allowing new styles to replace the defaults. The option is used as
`stack-colors: <STYLES>`, where `<STYLES>` is a colon-delimited sequence of
key=value, 'key' is a style name and 'value' is a semicolon-delimited list of
'ANSI' SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) control codes (in decimal). Use the
command `stack ls stack-colors --basic` to see the current sequence.

The 'ANSI' standards refer to (1) standard ECMA-48 'Control Functions for Coded
Character Sets' (5th edition, 1991); (2) extensions in ITU-T Recommendation
(previously CCITT Recommendation) T.416 (03/93) 'Information Technology – Open
Document Architecture (ODA) and Interchange Format: Character Content
Architectures' (also published as ISO/IEC International Standard 8613-6); and
(3) further extensions used by 'XTerm', a terminal emulator for the X Window
System. The 'ANSI' SGR codes are described in a
[Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
and those codes supported on current versions of Windows in
[Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences).

For example, users of the popular
[Solarized Dark](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/)
terminal theme might wish to set the styles as follows:

~~~yaml
stack-colors: error=31:good=32:shell=35:dir=34:recommendation=32:target=95:module=35:package-component=95:secondary=92:highlight=32
~~~
In respect of styles used in verbose output, some of that output occurs before
the configuration file is processed.

(The British English spelling (colour) is also accepted. In YAML configuration
files, the American spelling is the alternative that has priority.)

### stack-developer-mode

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.3.3](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.3.3)

Default (official distributed binaries): `false`

Default (built from source): `true`

Turns on a mode where some messages are printed at WARN level instead of DEBUG
level, especially useful for developers of Stack itself.

~~~yaml
stack-developer-mode: false
~~~

### system-ghc

Default: `false`, unless the [Docker](docker_integration.md) or
[Nix](nix_integration.md) integration is enabled.

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--[no-]system-ghc` flag

Enables or disables using the GHC available on the PATH. (Make sure PATH is
explicit, i.e., don't use ~.) Useful to enable if you want to save the time,
bandwidth or storage space needed to setup an isolated GHC.

In a Nix-enabled configuration, Stack is incompatible with `system-ghc: false`.

~~~yaml
# Turn on system GHC
system-ghc: true
~~~

### templates

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `stack new --param <key>:<value>`
(or `-p`) option

Templates used with `stack new` have a number of parameters that affect the
generated code. These can be set for all new projects you create. The result of
them can be observed in the generated LICENSE and Cabal files. The value for all
of these parameters must be strings.

The parameters are: `author-email`, `author-name`, `category`, `copyright`,
`year` and `github-username`.

* _author-email_ - sets the `maintainer` property in Cabal
* _author-name_ - sets the `author` property in Cabal and the name used in
  LICENSE
* _category_ - sets the `category` property in Cabal. This is used in Hackage.
  For examples of categories see
  [Packages by category](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/). It makes sense
  for `category` to be set on a per project basis because it is uncommon for all
  projects a user creates to belong to the same category. The category can be
  set per project by passing `-p "category:value"` to the `stack new` command.
* _copyright_ - sets the `copyright` property in Cabal. It is typically the
  name of the holder of the copyright on the package and the year(s) from which
  copyright is claimed. For example: `Copyright (c) 2006-2007 Joe Bloggs`
* _year_ - if `copyright` is not specified, `year` and `author-name` are used
  to generate the copyright property in Cabal. If `year` is not specified, it
  defaults to the current year.
* _github-username_ - used to generate `homepage` and `source-repository` in
  Cabal. For instance `github-username: myusername` and
  `stack new my-project new-template` would result:

~~~yaml
homepage: http://github.com/myusername/my-project#readme

source-repository head
  type: git
  location: https://github.com/myusername/my-project
~~~

These properties can be set in `config.yaml` as follows:
~~~yaml
templates:
  params:
    author-name: Your Name
    author-email: youremail@example.com
    category: Your Projects Category
    copyright: 'Copyright (c) 2023 Your Name'
    github-username: yourusername
~~~

Additionally, `stack new` can automatically initialize source control
repositories in the directories it creates.  Source control tools can be
specified with the `scm-init` option. At the moment, only `git` is supported.

~~~yaml
templates:
  scm-init: git
~~~

### urls

Default:

~~~yaml
urls:
  latest-snapshot: https://www.stackage.org/download/snapshots.json
~~~

Customize the URLs where Stack looks for snapshot build plans.

### with-gcc

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--with-gcc` option

Specify a path to GCC explicitly, rather than relying on the normal path
resolution.

~~~yaml
with-gcc: /usr/local/bin/gcc-5
~~~

### with-hpack

Command line equivalent (takes precedence): `--with-hpack` option

Use an [Hpack](https://github.com/sol/hpack) executable, rather than Stack's
in-built version of the Hpack functionality.

~~~yaml
with-hpack: /usr/local/bin/hpack
~~~

### work-dir

[:octicons-tag-24: 0.1.10.0](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v0.1.10.0)

Default: `.stack-work`

Command line equivalent (takes precedence):
[`--work-dir`](global_flags.md#-work-dir-option) option

Environment variable alternative (lowest precedence):
[`STACK_WORK`](environment_variables.md#stack_work)

`work-dir` specifies the path of Stack's work directory, within a local project
or package directory. The path must be a relative one, relative to the
root directory of the project or package. The relative path cannot include a
`..` (parent directory) component.

## Customisation scripts

### GHC installation customisation

[:octicons-tag-24: 2.9.1](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/releases/tag/v2.9.1)

On Unix-like operating systems and Windows, Stack's installation procedure can
be fully customised by placing a `sh` shell script (a 'hook') in the
[Stack root](stack_root.md) directory at `hooks/ghc-install.sh`. On Unix-like
operating systems, the script file must be made executable. The script is run by
the `sh` application (which is provided by MSYS2 on Windows).

The script **must** return an exit code of `0` and the standard output **must**
be the absolute path to the GHC binary that was installed. Otherwise Stack will
ignore the script and possibly fall back to its own installation procedure.

The script is not run when `system-ghc: true`.

When `install-ghc: false`, the script is still run, which allows you to ensure
that only your script will install GHC and Stack won't default to its own
installation logic, even when the script fails.

The following environment variables are always available to the script:

* `HOOK_GHC_TYPE = "bindist" | "git" | "ghcjs"`

For "bindist", additional variables are:

* `HOOK_GHC_VERSION = <ver>`

For "git", additional variables are:

* `HOOK_GHC_COMMIT = <commit>`
* `HOOK_GHC_FLAVOR = <flavor>`

For "ghcjs", additional variables are:

* `HOOK_GHC_VERSION = <ver>`
* `HOOK_GHCJS_VERSION = <ver>`

An example script is:

~~~sh
#!/bin/sh

set -eu

case $HOOK_GHC_TYPE in
	bindist)
		# install GHC here, not printing to stdout, e.g.:
		#   command install $HOOK_GHC_VERSION >/dev/null
		;;
	git)
		>&2 echo "Hook doesn't support installing from source"
		exit 1
		;;
	*)
		>&2 echo "Unsupported GHC installation type: $HOOK_GHC_TYPE"
		exit 2
		;;
esac

echo "location/to/ghc/executable"
~~~

If the following script is installed by GHCup, GHCup makes use of it, so that if
Stack needs a version of GHC, GHCup takes over obtaining and installing that
version:

~~~sh
#!/bin/sh

set -eu

case $HOOK_GHC_TYPE in
    bindist)
        ghcdir=$(ghcup whereis --directory ghc "$HOOK_GHC_VERSION" || ghcup run --ghc "$HOOK_GHC_VERSION" --install) || exit 3
        printf "%s/ghc" "${ghcdir}"
        ;;
    git)
        # TODO: should be somewhat possible
        >&2 echo "Hook doesn't support installing from source"
        exit 1
        ;;
    *)
        >&2 echo "Unsupported GHC installation type: $HOOK_GHC_TYPE"
        exit 2
        ;;
esac
~~~
