# This project-level configuration file is intended to be used with, and only
# with, macOS. It specifies process-1.6.15.0 as a dependency, which includes
# important bug fixes for macOS. When building test suite stack-test, Stack will
# warn:
#
#   This package indirectly depends on multiple versions of the same package.
#   This is very likely to cause a compile failure.
#
# but macOS, unlike other operating systems, appears able to avoid that failure.

# GHC 9.2.4
