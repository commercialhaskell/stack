-- | Update YAML preserving top-level key order, blank lines and comments.
--
-- The call sequence is mkRaw, encodeInOrder, redress and unmkRaw but if you
-- don't care about preserving trailing blank lines this can be simplified to
-- encodeInOrder and redress.
--
-- Use yamlLines to transform 'RawYaml' to ['RawYamlLine'].
