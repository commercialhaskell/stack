about: Ask a question about Stack usage
---

Do you have a question regarding Stack's usage that isn't covered by
[the docs](http://haskellstack.org)? In that case please ask your question on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and use
[the haskell-stack tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell-stack).
This way your question will be more easily discoverable by other people with the
same question.

Question related to Stack project templates? Please report it at the
[stack-templates](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates)
repository instead.

If you still want to ask the question here instead, please make sure that you
are using the latest release (currently Stack 2.9.1). See the
[upgrade instructions](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#upgrade)
to upgrade.
