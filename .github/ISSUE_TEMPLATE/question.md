about: Ask a question about Stack usage
---

Do you have a question regarding stack's usage that isn't covered by [the docs](http://haskellstack.org)?
In that case please ask your question on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and use [the haskell-stack tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell-stack).
This way your question will be more easily discoverable by other people with the same question.

Question related to stack project templates? Please report it at the [stack-templates](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates) repository instead.

if you still want to ask the question here instead, please make sure that you are using the latest release (current stack-1.7.1).
See the [upgrade instructions](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#upgrade) to upgrade.
